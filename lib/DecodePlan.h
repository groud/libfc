/** Decode plans describe how a data record is to be decoded.
 *
 * Decoding a data record means determining, for each data field,
 *
 *   - if the data's endianness must be converted;
 *   - if the data needs to be transformed in any other way (for
 *     example, boolean values are encoded with 1 meaning true and 2
 *     meaning false(!!), or reduced-length encoding of floating-point
 *     values means that doubles are really transferred as floats);
 *   - for variable-length data, what the length of the encoded value
 *     is; and
 *   - where the converted data is to be stored.
 *
 * Basically, clients register sets of pairs of <ie, pointer> with the
 * IPFIXContentHandler class below.  This is called a Placement Template.
 * This placement template will then be used to match incoming data
 * records.  The previously used procedure was to nominate the first
 * placement template whose set of information elements is a subset of
 * the information elements for the data set in question. We
 * implement this here as well, but it might be changed easily.  (For
 * example, we might reasonably select that placement template that is a
 * subset of the data set's template and at the same time matches the
 * most fields.)
 *
 * Now having a template for the data set (called a Wire Template) and
 * a matching placement template, we create a Decoding Plan.  Basically,
 * a decoding plan is a sequence of decisions, one for each field.
 * There are two types of decisions:
 *
 *   - A SKIP decision causes the corresponding field to be skipped.
 *   - A TRANSFER decision causes the corresponding field to be
 *     endianness-converted if necessary (this can be gleaned form the
 *     corresponding information element's type), and copied to the
 *     pointer that the client gave at the time of registration.
 *
 * For convenience, there exist two variations of each decision,
 * depending on whether the corresponding field is fixed-length field
 * or a variable-length field.
 *
 * It would be nice if we could collapse two adjacent SKIP decisions
 * into one, but that can only be done if the two fields in question
 * are fixed-length fields.  We might do this in a future release if
 * it turns out to be a performance problem.
