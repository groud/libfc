/** An error context.
 *
 * This class is used to show upper layers where in the processing
 * of a particular InputSource an error happened and what kind of
 * error it is.  For this purpose, an ErrorContext object contains
 * the error that happened, the value of errno, and the InputSource
 * in which the error occurred.
 *
 * The InputSource object also holds information about the location
 * of the error, in the form of offset counters. (Depending on the
 * type of input source, the offset may or may not be meaningful.
 * For example, for message-based input sources, such as
 * UDPInputSource, the offset of the current message makes no sense,
 * since there is no message stream.)
 *
 * Many of the functions that parse messages return a pointer to an
 * ErrorContext.  That pointer is non-0 if an error occurred, and 0
 * otherwise.  The ContentHandler methods are called from a
 * MessageStreamParser object's parse() function that in turn
 * returns such a pointer.  The idea is that all functions where
 * potential errors may occur return an ErrorContext pointer.  This
 * then causes the caller to stop what it's doing, potentially
 * augmenting the ErrorContext object with additional information
 * and passing it to the caller's caller and so on, right up to the
 * initial caller of parse().
 *
 * If a method detects an error itself (as opposed to calling a
 * method that returns a non-0 ErrorContext pointer), you should use
 * the LIBFC_RETURN_ERROR macro somewhat like this (see the
 * documentation for error_severity_t below and Error::error_t in
 * the Error class):
 *
 * @code
 * uint8_t* message = ...;
 * uint16_t size = ...;
 * uint16_t off = ...;
 *
 * if (some_error_condition) {
 *   LIBFC_RETURN_ERROR(recoverable, short_header,
 *                     "Expected " << kMessageHeaderSize
 *                                 << " bytes in header, got "
 *                                 << nbytes,
 *                      system_errno, is, message, size, off);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * If you call a function that returns a non-zero ErrorContext
 * pointer, you should do something like this:
 *
 * @code
 * std::shared_ptr<ErrorContext> p = func(message + offset);
 * if (p != 0) {
 *   p->set_message(message, size);
 *   p->set_offset(p->get_offset() + offset);
 *   return p;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * In this example, we assumed that func() didn't have access to the
 * entire message, so we augmented the error context object and
 * adjusted the offset.
 *
 * It is expected that occurrences like these willl be rare, so it's
 * perfectly OK if the code in the error handler is somewhat slow.
 * Don't try to write clever code, @em{especially} not in error
 * handling.
