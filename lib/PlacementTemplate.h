/** Association between IEs and memory locations.
 *
 * @section INTRODUCTION
 *
 * IPFIX is sometimes called a <em>self-describing format</em>.  In
 * order to self-describe, an IPFIX message contains <em>template
 * records</em> that describe the format of the <em>data
 * records</em>, which contain the content.  A template record
 * basically says, "Hi, I'm a template record with the identifying
 * number 1234.  Later in this message, there may be collection of
 * data records, called a <em>data set</em>, also having the
 * identifying number 1234.  This means that the records in that
 * data set will have the following structure: [...]" That structure
 * is then described by giving a sequence of <em>information
 * elements</em> (and their encoded lengths as they appear on the
 * wire).  For example, a simplified version of a flow template
 * record could look like this:
 *
 * <table>
 *   <tr><th>IE name</th><th>length</th></tr>
 *   <tr><td>flowStartMilliseconds</td><td>8</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>flowEndMilliseconds</td><td>8</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>sourceIPv4Address</td><td>4</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>destinationIPv4Address</td><td>4</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>sourceTransportPort</td><td>2</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>destinationTransportPort</td><td>2</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>protocolIdentifier</td><td>1</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>octetDeltaCount</td><td>4</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * (This is a simplified template record because a real record would
 * contain not the information element names, but rather some
 * identifying numbers.)
 *
 * Then this means that later data sets with this template ID will
 * contain the given information elements in this order, with this
 * length.  Now it would be nice if we could read in a data record
 * and map it to a struct, simply by casting a pointer to the data
 * read from the data source.  But that is not possible for a number
 * of reasons:
 *
 *  - The data might need to undergo <em>endianness conversion</em>.
 *    For example, numbers will appear on the wire in network byte
 *    order (big endian), but the native format will be host byte
 *    order, which might be little endian.  This conversion affects
 *    some, but not all, information elements.  For example, the
 *    flowStartMilliseconds and sourceIPv4Address information
 *    elements are affected, whereas a sourceIPv6Address information
 *    element would not be affected.
 *
 *  - Some information elements have variable length; this is
 *    known as <em>varlen encoding</em>.  Obviously, varlen-encoded
 *    information elements cannot be directly mapped to structs,
 *    because structs have a fixed length, available with the
 *    <code>sizeof</code> operator.
 *
 *  - Some information element types cannot be directly mapped to
 *    native C++ data types.  Examples would be the
 *    <tt>octetArray</tt> and <tt>string</tt> data types.
 *
 *  - Information elements can be encoded on the wire with a length
 *    that is less than the length that would be implied by the
 *    information element's type.  This is called <em>reduced-length
 *    encoding</em>.  For example, the octetDeltaCount is of type
 *    <tt>unsigned64</tt>, but if only 32 of those 64 bits would be
 *    needed in a particular application, then the information
 *    element may appear on the wire with a length of just four
 *    octets.
 *
 *  - In a data record, the information elements follow one another
 *    without any <em>padding</em>. This can lead to data that is
 *    not suitably aligned.  For example, the protocolIdentifier
 *    information element above is only 1 octet long, causing the
 *    following octetDeltaCount information element to be aligned on
 *    an odd address (assuming that the base address was aligned on
 *    an even address).
 *
 *  - A collection process might not be interested in all
 *    information elements, but only in a <em>selection</em>, so
 *    forcing it to receive the entire data record would be
 *    unreasonable.
 *
 *  - The collection process might, for its very own reasons, want
 *    to <em>scatter</em> the information elements in its address
 *    space, not keeping them together as in a struct.
 *
 * An IPFIX collection process will therefore ultimately need to
 * decide where an information element as it appears in an IPFIX
 * data record will have to be stored in memory, just as an IPFIX
 * exporter will have to decide where an information element that is
 * to be exported will take its data from. This class provides the
 * association between a set of information elements and
 * corresponding memory locations.
 *
 * Here is how it works.  Let's say you're interested in flow
 * records like the one shown in the above table, but you're only
 * interested in the source and destination IP addresses, and not
 * the other information elements.  We encapsulate this in a data
 * structure that we call a <em>placement template</em>, and this
 * code would let you express that interest:
 *
 * @code
 * uint32_t sip;
 * uint32_t dip;
 * libfc::InfoModel& model = IPFIX::InfoModel::instance();
 *
 * PlacementTemplate* my_flow_template = new PlacementTemplate();
 *
 * my_flow_template->register_placement(
 *    model.lookupIE("sourceIPv4Address"),
 *    &sip);
 * my_flow_template->register_placement(
 *    model.lookupIE("destinationIPv4Address"),
 *    &dip);
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @section COLLECTION
 *
 * Now before you can start collecting records with these
 * information elements, you need two more things: first, you need
 * to tell someone that you want this placement template to go into
 * effect, and second, you need a way for that someone to tell you
 * that it's just read a record that matched this placement template
 * and that it has placed the values form the data record into the
 * pointers that you have provided in that placement template.  All
 * this is provided by a custom class derived from
 * PlacementCollector (we will be using the IPFIX namespace for
 * simplicity):
 *
 * @code
 * class MyCollector : public PlacementCollector {
 * public:
 *   MyCollector() {
 *      // Create and fill my_flow_template as above
 *
 *      register_placement_template(my_flow_template);
 *   }
 *
 *   void end_placement(const PlacementTemplate* tmpl) {
 *     // At this point, there are fresh values in this->sip
 *     // and this->dip
 *   }
 *
 * private:
 *  uint32_t sip;
 *  uint32_t dip;
 * };
 *
 * MyCollector cb;
 *
 * int fd = open(filename.c_str(), O_RDONLY);
 * if (fd >= 0) {
 *   FileInputSource is(fd);
 *   try {
 *     cb.collect(is);
 *   } catch (FormatError e) {
 *     std::cerr << "Format error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
 *   }
 *   (void) close(fd);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * And that's all, folks!
 *
 * It should be noted that it is possible to register more than one
 * placement template in the MyCollector constructor:
 *
 * @code
 *   MyCollector() {
 *     PlacementTemplate* my_flow_template = new PlacementTemplate();
 *     // Fill my_flow_template as above
 *      register_placement_template(my_flow_template);
 *
 *     PlacementTemplate* my_observation_template = new PlacementTemplate();
 *     // Fill my_obsrevation_template similarly
 *      register_placement_template(my_observation_template);
 *   }
 * @endcode
 *
 * This is the reason why the end_placement() member function has a
 * PlacementTemplate pointer parameter: so that you can distinguish
 * which of your templates has just been matched and hence which of
 * your data members now have fresh content.  Obviously, for this,
 * the template pointers should be data members of MyCollector.
 *
 * @section EXPORT
 *
 * Placement templates can also be used for export.  In fact, export
 * using the placement interface is slightly simpler than
 * collection, since no custom derived class is needed. (The reason
 * for this is that export needs no callback function, since the
 * information flow is now from the program to the IPFIX messages.)
 *
 * Let's say you want to write IPFIX records to a file, and that you
 * have a file descriptor for that file in the variable
 * <code>fd</code>.  Here is how you could export flow records:
 *
 * @code
 * FileExportDestination d(fd);
 * PlacementExporter exporter(d, 0x12344321);
 *
 * uint64_t flow_start_milliseconds = ...;
 * uint64_t flow_end_milliseconds = ...;
 * uint32_t source_ip_v4_address = ...;
 * uint32_t destination_ip_v4_address = ...;
 * uint16_t source_transport_port = ...;
 * uint16_t destination_transport_port = ...;
 * uint8_t  protocol_identifier = ...;
 * uint64_t octet_delta_count = ...;
 *
 * PlacementTemplate* my_flow_template = new PlacementTemplate();
 * // Fill template as above
 *
 * exporter.place_values(my_flow_template);
 *
 * // more calls to place_values()
 *
 * exporter.flush();
 *
 * delete my_flow_template;
 * @endcode
 *
 * And that's all!
