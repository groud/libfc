 * must implement.  Only implementers of ExportDestination
 * subclasses should read this documentation.  All others are
 * referred to to the documentation of that subclass.
 *
 * IPFIX export with the placement interface works with
 * scatter-gather I/O, which in Unix-like or POSIX-compatible
 * operating systems is done with the @code{writev} system call,
 * which will have to be delegated by an implementation of this
 * interface.
 *
 * Furthermore, there is a difference between connection-oriented
 * and connectionless export destinations because on connectionless
 * exports, each message must contain all templates for all data
 * sets included in that message, which is not true for
 * connection-oriented protocols.
 *
 * Finally, connectionless export destinations might have a
 * preferred message size because large messages will cause
 * fragmentation, and the loss of a fragment means the loss of the
 * entire message.  It is therefore advantageous to have messages
 * that are only as large as the path MTU.
